# The diversity of data

**Data can always be represented in various ways.**

But **some ways are** more common and **easier to understand and use** than others.

> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way (Leo Tolstoy).

> Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way ([Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)).

# Data tidying

In most cases, data have to be brought into a specific format before they can be analyzed.

--

Why?

--

- structure of the dataset is not in line with the **requirements of the methods/tools** we use

--

- clean data with standardized structure makes it **easier for others to reuse the data**

--

- organizing every dataset organized the same way **facilitates the reuse of code**

--

- R-specific: **R works with vectors** (hence it makes sense to have 1 column = 1 variable & 1 row = 1 observation)

---

class: center, middle

## Let's have a look at a few examples

In the following, we will compare different ways of organizing the same data.

We will use country-level data on population and cases of a disease.

---

class: center, middle

```{r color table 1 setup, message = F, warning = F, error = F, results = 'markup'}
color_table(head(table2, n = 8), body_bg = green, header_bg = blue)
```
.large[
What's the problem here?
]

---

```{r type var table}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  blue, blue, blue, blue,
  green, green, green, yellow,
  green, green, green, green,
  green, green, green, green ),
  ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
color_table(head(table2, n = 3), body_bg = color_mat)
```

--

.pull-left[
**Problems**
1. Interpretation of cells depends on other cells

2. Hard to vectorize

3. 1 column for 2 variables
]

.pull-right[
**Details**
1. The interpretation of 745 depends on the value of "type".

2. R uses vectors internally. Most functions expect a column to represent one cohesive selection of values (e.g., a variable or an observation). Both, "type" and "count" are not.

3. "type" switches the meaning of "count". This is highly unintuitive and not what (most) people would expect.

```{r color table 2 setup}
color_table(table3, body_bg = green, header_bg = blue)
```
.large[
What's the problem here?
]

---

```{r rate}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  blue, blue, blue,
  green, green, yellow,
  green, green, green,
  green, green, green ),
  ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
color_table(head(table3, n = 3), body_bg = color_mat)
```

--

.pull-left[
**Problems**
1. Cells contain several values

2. Cells are strings but represent a number (rate)
]

.pull-right[
**Details**
1. Rate still has to be computed.

2. It's difficult to run numeric operations on string variables.
]

---

<h1>For the aces of base (R)</h1>

Would you know how to calculate the rate using base R in this case?
E.g. .highlight["745/19987071"]?  
.smaller[
(Without googling?)
]

--

Would your code look something like the following?  

```{r separate base, echo = T}
rate <- c("745/19987071", "2666/20695360")
as.numeric(gsub(rate, pattern = "([0-9]+)/[0-9]+",
                replacement = "\\1")) /
as.numeric(gsub(rate, pattern = "[0-9]+/([0-9]+)",
                replacement = "\\1"))
```

# Rules for tidy datasets

The 3 rules of tidy data:

1. Each **variable** is in a separate **column**.

2. Each **observation** is in a separate **row**.

3. Each **value** is in a separate **cell**.

NB: In the tidyverse 'tidy data' also means data in long format - where applicable.

# Wide vs. long format

# 'Gather' a variable

How to gather/collect a variable that had been spread over 2 columns?  

```{r wide table}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  blue, blue, blue,
  green, yellow, yellow,
  green, green, green,
  green, green, green ),
  ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
color_table(head(table4a, n = 3), body_bg = color_mat)
```

Here, a count variable is spread over 2 columns.  

This is also known as **'wide' format**. It's commonly used and there's nothing inherently wrong with it.  

But sometimes **'long' format** is required (e.g., for plotting with `ggplot2`).

---

# 'Gather' a variable

```{r wide table short}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  green, yellow, yellow),
  ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
color_table(head(table4a, n = 1), body_bg = color_mat)
```

--

The tidyverse verb `gather` converts the wide format into the long format.

```{r gather, echo = T, eval = F}
table4a %>%
  head(n = 1) %>%
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases") #<<
```

--

```{r gathered table}
table4a %>%
  head(n = 1) %>%
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases") %>%
  color_table()
```

Here, the two columns "1999" and "2000" are gathered into "year" and the counts into "cases".

---

# 'Spread' a variable

How to tidy up observations that were spread over two rows?  

```{r type table short}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  green, green, yellow, yellow,
  green, green, yellow, yellow),
  ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
color_table(head(table2, n = 2), body_bg = color_mat, header_bg = blue)
```

Here, one observation was spread over 2 rows.  

NB: This is **NOT** an appropriate long format because the columns are not cohesive collections of values.

---

# 'Spread' a variable

```{r spread table}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  green, green, yellow, yellow,
  green, green, yellow, yellow),
  ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
color_table(head(table2, n = 2), body_bg = color_mat, header_bg = blue)
```

--

The tidyverse verb `spread` converts the incohesive selection of values into cohesive vectors/variables.

```{r spread, eval = F, echo = T}
table2 %>%
  head(n = 2) %>%
  spread(key = type, value = count) #<<
```

--

```{r spread table result}
table2 %>%
  head(n = 2) %>%
  spread(key = type, value = count) %>%
  color_table()
```

Here, the values in "type" become column names of two vectors/variables and the respective values are stored in cells.

---

# Pivot 

With the development version of `tidyr` (install with `devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")`) and in future *CRAN* releases, you can also use `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` instead of `gather()` and `spread()` (see https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html).

```{r pivot, eval = F, echo = T}
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to ="year", values_to = "count")

table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```


---

# 'Separate' intermingled values

The tidyverse verb `separate` allows us to separate intermingled values.

```{r separate table}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  green, green, yellow),
  ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

table3 %>%
  head(n = 1) %>%
  color_table(body_bg = color_mat)
```

```{r separate echo, echo = T, eval = F}
table3 %>%
  head(n = 2) %>%
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population")) #<<
```

```{r separate eval}
table3 %>%
  head(n = 2) %>%
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population")) %>%
  color_table()
```

---

# Separators

By default `separate()` will split on any non-alphanumeric character, but you can also specify the separating character with the argument 'sep':  

```{r mingled echo, echo = T, eval = F}
tibble(mingled = "80/100#1,6_3") %>%
  separate(mingled, into = c("value_1", "value_2"), sep = "#")
```

```{r mingled eval}
tibble(mingled = "80/100#1,6_3") %>%
  separate(mingled, into = c("value_1", "value_2"), sep = "#") %>%
  color_table()
```
--

```{r separate mingled, echo = T, eval = F}
tibble(mingled = "80/100#1,6_3") %>%
  separate(mingled, into = c("value_1", "value_2"))
```

```{r separate mingled eval}
tibble(mingled = "80/100#1,6_3") %>%
  separate(mingled, into = c("value_1", "value_2")) %>%
  color_table()
```
---

# 'Unite' values

The tidyverse verb `unite` lets us concatenate values that are spread over multiple columns. By default, without specifying 'sep', values are separated by an underscore, '_'. 

```{r unite table}
color_mat <- matrix(c(
  green, yellow, yellow),
  ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

table5 %>%
  select(country, century, year) %>%
  head(n = 1) %>%
  color_table(body_bg = color_mat)

table5 <- table5 %>% 
  select(country, century, year)
```

```{r unite echo, echo = T, eval = F}
table5 %>%
  head(n = 1) %>%
  unite(yyyy, century, year, sep = "") #<<
```

```{r unite eval}
table5 %>%
  head(n = 1) %>%
  unite(yyyy, century, year, sep = "") %>%
  color_table()
```
