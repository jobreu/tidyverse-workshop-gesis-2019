# Data wrangling

In this section (and the following one), we will focus on the `dplyr` package.

# Data wrangling `r ji("cowboy_hat_face")`

.pull-left[
We split up **wrangling** into two parts:
- **Part 1** (now)
    - renaming variables
    - selecting variables: basics
    - filtering cases: basics
    - creating new variables: basics
    - recoding variable values
    - recoding missing values
    
- **Part 2** (1st session tomorrow)
    - advanced selecting
    - advanced filtering
    - advanced creation of new variables
    - working with factors
    - rearranging datasets

# Titanic `r ji("passenger_ship")`

For some of the data wrangling examples and exercises we will use the Titanic dataset from [*Kaggle*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)

```{r titanic data, include = F}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```


```{r read titanic codebook, include = FALSE}
titanic_codebook <- read_csv2("../../data/titanic/titanic_codebook.csv")
```

```{r titanic codebook, echo = FALSE}
titanic_codebook %>%
  kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 16)
```

---

# Side note: Codebooks

If you want to generate a codebook for your dataset, there are several options:

- The [`codebook` package](https://github.com/rubenarslan/codebook) which includes an *RStudio*-Addin and also offers a [web app](https://rubenarslan.ocpu.io/codebook/www/)

- the `makeCodebook()` function from the [`dataMaid` package](https://github.com/ekstroem/dataMaid) (see this [blog post](http://sandsynligvis.dk/articles/18/codebook.html) for a short tutorial)

- the `codebook()` function from the [`memisc` package](https://github.com/melff/memisc)

# Data frame check

It's always good to first check how clean or messy your data is and whether or where it needs cleaning.  

The `glimpse()` function from `dplyr` is usually a good start as it similar to `str()` base R but tries to display as many data points as possible (in the Console).  

The second thing you could/should do (esp. if you have many/mostly numeric variables) is to use the `summary()` function from base R.  

If you want more detailed summaries of your data, you can have a look at the [`skimr`](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) and [`summarytools`](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools) packages.

---

# Data frame check 1

```{r glimpse, echo = T}
glimpse(titanic)
```

---

# Data frame check 2

```{r summary_df, include = F}
titanic_num <- titanic %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric)
```

```{r summary, echo = T}
summary(titanic_num)
```

---

# `dplyr` functions

.large[
- `dplyr` functions are verbs that signal an action  

- first argument = a data frame  

- output normally also a data frame (tibble) 

- columns (= variables in a tidy data frame) can be referenced without quotation marks (non-standard evaluation)
]

---

# Renaming variables

```{r titanic head rename, echo = T}
names(titanic)
```

Some of the names of in the Titanic dataset are difficult to understand (without consulting the codebook). In addition, it is generally helpful to use a consistent naming scheme. As `R` is case-sensitive, we might want to only use lowercase letters. As spaces in variable names can cause problems (or at least headaches), we could opt for`r ji("snake")` snake_case (`r ji("camel")` camelCase is a common alternative; for a good brief discussion of options for avoiding spaces in variable names, see this [Medium post by Patrick Divine](https://medium.com/@pddivine/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841)).

Note: For common data cleaning tasks, you might also want to have a look at the [`janitor` package](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) which is tidyverse-oriented and includes the function `clean_names()`.

# `dplyr::rename`

```{r titanic rename, echo = T}
titanic <- titanic %>% 
  rename(passenger_id = PassengerId,
         survived = Survived,
         ticket_class = Pclass,
         name = Name,
         sex = Sex,
         age = Age,
         nr_of_siblings_spouses_aboard = SibSp,
         nr_of_parents_children_aboard = Parch,
         ticket_number = Ticket,
         fare = Fare,
         cabin_nr = Cabin,
         port_of_embarkation = Embarked)

names(titanic)
```

---

# Selecting variables

Very often we do not need all the variables in a dataset for our analyses. We can create a selection of columns/variables with the `dplyr` verb `select()`.

```{r select, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(passenger_id, survived, ticket_class, sex, age)
```

---

# Selecting a range of variables

```{r select range, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(name:age)
```

---

# Unselecting variables

```{r unselect, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(-survived)
```

---

# Unselecting a range of variables

```{r unselect range, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  select(-(name:port_of_embarkation))
```

---

# Filtering cases

With the `filter()` function from `dplyr` you can filter rows/observations dependent on one or more conditions.

You can use the usual operators for 
- **comparisons**:
    - **<** (smaller than)
    - **<=** (smaller than or equal to)
    - **==** (equal to)
    - **!=** (not equal to)
    - **>=** (larger than or equal to)
    - **>** (larger than)  
    
- **logical operators**:
    - **&** (and)
    - **|** (or)
    - **!** (not)
    - **xor** (either or, not both)

---

# `dplyr::filter` - one condition

```{r filter 1, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  filter(sex == "male")
```

---

# `dplyr::filter` - multiple conditions

```{r filter 2, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  filter(sex == "male", survived == 1, age >= 18)
```

NB: Multiple conditions in filter are automatically added as & (and).

---

# Creating new variables

In the process of preparing data for analyses we usually want to create new variables (often based on existing ones). For example, in the Titanic dataset, we might want to calculate the total number of relatives aboard the Titanic for each passenger.

```{r Titanic mutate sum relatives, echo = T}
titanic <- titanic %>% 
  mutate(nr_of_relatives_aboard = nr_of_siblings_spouses_aboard +
           nr_of_parents_children_aboard)

titanic %>% 
  select(nr_of_relatives_aboard) %>% 
  filter(nr_of_relatives_aboard > 1) %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```

---

# Recoding variable values

```{r Titanic embark}
titanic %>% 
  select(port_of_embarkation) %>% 
  head()
```

Without looking at the codebook, it is not clear what the letters in the *Embarked* variable stand for. If we want to, e.g., produce tables or plots using this variable, it might help to replace the abbreviation by the full name of the port of embarkation.

---

# `dplyr::recode`

```{r recode, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  mutate(port_of_embarkation = recode(port_of_embarkation,
         S = "Southampton",
         C = "Cherbourg",
         Q = "Queenstown")) %>% 
  select(port_of_embarkation) %>% 
  head()
```

Note that we recode into the same variable here. If we wanted to create a new variable with the recoded values, we would simply have to give it a different name.

---

# Missing values

In the real world (of data collection and analysis) it is quite rare to have datasets without missing data. When we prepare our data for analysis there are generally two things we might want/have to do with regard to missing values:

- define specific values as missings

- recode `NA` values into something else (for example, to distinguish between different types of missing values)

Note: An interesting option for exploring and working with missing data is the [`naniar` package](http://naniar.njtierney.com/) which, according to its documentation, "provides principled, tidy ways to summarise, visualise, and manipulate missing data".  

---

# Recode `NA` into something else with `tidyr::replace_na`

```{r missing example}
titanic %>% 
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

```{r recode NAs, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  mutate(cabin_nr = replace_na(cabin_nr, "unknown")) %>% 
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

---

# Recode specific values as `NA` with `dplyr::na_if`

```{r recode NAs 2}
titanic <- titanic %>% 
  mutate(cabin_nr = replace_na(cabin_nr, "unknown"))

titanic %>% 
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```

```{r recode as NA, echo = T}
titanic %>% 
  mutate(cabin_nr = na_if(cabin_nr, "unknown")) %>% 
  select(cabin_nr) %>% 
  head(n = 3)
```
