# Getting data into `R`

.large[
Thus far, we've already learned that data can be untidy.

This course is also about making them tidy (as well as 'wrangling' and exploring them).

There's one important prerequisite:

.center[**We need data!**]
]

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/import_data.png")
```

# Getting Data in the tidyverse

Whether we want to use our own data or data from others, we need to get data into R.

The `tidyverse` provides some nice tools to do exactly that:

- `readr`  (for 'flat' files, such as CSV)
- `readxl` (for excel spreadsheets)
- `haven`  (for statistical software files, such as SPSS, Stata, and SAS)

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/hex_all_in_one.png")
```

A key difference between these packages and others is that `tidyverse` import functions already prepare the data for being 'tidied': they are a `tibbles`


---
# A readr example: `read_csv()`
```{r readr_example, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```

Note the column specifications. `readr` 'guesses' them based on the first 1000 observations (we will come back to this later).


---
# A readr example: `read_csv()`
```{r readr_example:output, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

It's that easy!

---
# A readxl example: `read_excel()`
```{r readxl_example, echo = TRUE}
unicorns <- read_xlsx("../../data/unicorns/observations.xlsx")
```

No output `r ji("frowning_face")`

---
# A readxl example: `read_excel()`
```{r readxl_example_output, echo = TRUE}
unicorns
```

---
# A haven example: `read_stata()` 
```{r read_stata_example, echo = TRUE}
gesis_panel <- 
  read_stata("../../data/gesis_panel_campusfile/ZA5666_v1-0-0_Stata14.dta")
```

---
# A haven example: `read_stata()` 
```{r read_stata_example_output, echo = TRUE}
gesis_panel
```

---
# There's more
These were just some very first examples of applying functions from each package. They comprise even more functions for different data types.

- readr
  - `read_csv()`
  - `read_tsv()`
  - `read_delim()`
  - `read_fwf()`
  - `read_table()`
  - `read_log()`
- haven
  - `read_sas()`
  - `read_spss()`
  - `read_stata()`

Not to mention all the helper functions and options. For example, we can define the cells to read from an excel file by specifying the option `range = "C1:E4"` in
`read_excel()`

# Changing Variable Types
As mentioned before, `read_csv` 'guesses' the variable types by scanning the first 1000 observations. NB: **This can go wrong!**

Luckily, we can change the variable type...

- before/while loading the data

- and after loading the data

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_change, echo = TRUE}
titanic <-
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      PassengerId = col_double(),
      Survived = col_double(),
      Pclass = col_double(),
      Name = col_character(),
      Sex = col_character(),
      Age = col_double(),
      SibSp = col_double(),
      Parch = col_double(),
      Ticket = col_character(),
      Fare = col_double(),
      Cabin = col_character(),
      Embarked = col_character()
    )
  )
```

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_change_display, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_changeD, echo = TRUE}
titanic <-
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      PassengerId = col_double(),
      Survived = col_double(),
      Pclass = col_double(),
      Name = col_character(),
      Sex = col_factor(), # This one changed!
      Age = col_double(),
      SibSp = col_double(),
      Parch = col_double(),
      Ticket = col_character(),
      Fare = col_double(),
      Cabin = col_character(),
      Embarked = col_character()
    )
  )
```

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_changeD_display, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

---
# After Loading the data
```{r readr_example_col_change_after, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```

---
# After Loading the data
```{r readr_example_col_changeD_after, echo = TRUE}
titanic <-
  type_convert( #<<
    titanic,
    col_types = cols(
      PassengerId = col_double(),
      Survived = col_double(),
      Pclass = col_double(),
      Name = col_character(),
      Sex = col_factor(),
      Age = col_double(),
      SibSp = col_double(),
      Parch = col_double(),
      Ticket = col_character(),
      Fare = col_double(),
      Cabin = col_character(),
      Embarked = col_character()
    )
  )
```

# Exporting Data
Sometimes our data have to leave the `tidyverse` (or even `R`), for example, if we....

- share data with colleagues who do not use `R`
- want to continue where we left off
  - particularly, if data wrangling took a long time
  
For such purposes we also need a way to export our data.

All of the packages we have discussed in this session also have designated functions for that.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/export_data.png")
```

---
# Examples: CSV and Stata files
```{r export_csv, echo = TRUE}
write_csv(titanic, "titanic_own.csv")
```

```{r export_stata, echo = TRUE}
write_dta(titanic, "titanic_own.dta")
```

Proof that they have been exported:
```{r list_files, echo = TRUE}
list.files() 
```

---
# Additional Packages
The great benefit of `tidyverse` import functions is the import of the data as tibbles: the data are potentially tidier.

Several other non-tidyverse packages provide similar benefits as they make use of this universal data format:
- [`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) for geospatial data

- [`sjlabelled`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjlabelled/index.html) to work with labelled data, e.g., from SPSS or Stata

---
# Alternative Packages

- `base` R

- the [`foreign` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/index.html) for SPSS and Stata files

- [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) for large datasets
